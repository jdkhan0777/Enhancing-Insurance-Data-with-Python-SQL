# Insurance Data Analysis & Optimization 

# Project Overview
  This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and extracting meaningful insights from an insurance dataset using **Python** and **SQL**. The goal was to prepare high-quality data for better 
  decision-making and explore customer behaviors, claims, and policies to optimize business strategies.  

# Key Steps & Technologies Used

# 1. Data Cleaning (Python - Pandas & NumPy)
- Loaded the raw dataset and handled missing values.  
- Standardized column names for better readability.  
- Converted data types where necessary (e.g., numerical values).  
- Removed inconsistencies and duplicate records.  
- Normalized income and claim values for better analysis.  

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Python - Matplotlib & Seaborn)  
- Visualized key trends in claims, customer demographics, and policy types.  
- Identified correlations between factors like income, coverage type, and claim amounts.  
- Explored customer lifetime value (CLV) to identify high-value customers.  

# 3. SQL-Based Analysis  
- Queried the cleaned dataset to extract meaningful business insights.  
- Calculated average claim amounts per coverage type.  
- Analyzed customer distribution based on employment status and policy types.  
- Identified high-risk customers by filtering based on claim history.  
- Extracted insights on vehicle class, sales channels, and renewal patterns.  

# Technologies & Tools Used  
  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data cleaning & visualization  
  SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite) – Data querying & business insights  
  Jupyter Notebook – Interactive data analysis  
  Git & GitHub – Version control & project sharing  

## Business Impact & Insights 
   Improved data quality by eliminating inconsistencies and missing values.  
   Identified customer segments with high claims, helping in risk assessment.  
   Extracted valuable insights on policy renewals and customer engagement.  
   Provided structured, SQL-ready data for further predictive modeling.
